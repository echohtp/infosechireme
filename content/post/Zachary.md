### Zachary
## Infosec, Analyst

I am a student at the University of Maryland Baltimore County. Where I study an Interdisciplinary / Individualized degree with a focus on Resilient Technologies and Disaster Management. I have a experience in volunteering in the disaster relief field and re-establishing technologies for critical infrastructures and first responders. So I am looking for a job in which I get to do two of the things I love giving back to communities in crisis and doing cyber security/IT.
