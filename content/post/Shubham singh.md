### Shubham singh
## Pentester

Hello sir/ma'am,
  I'm Shubham singh. Currently I am pursuing bachelors in Computer applications (BCA) and I am passionate about my work. I love finding vulnerabilities in systems, software and websites. I am a 
self-learner. I also use to play many CTFs and due to which even I got a chance to represent my country in 
an international event name WorldSkills. Also, I am a huge fan of sharing my knowledge so I used to 
write walkthroughs from where the new infosec ninjas can learn. Apart from it I have a YouTube channel 
where I used to make videos to showcase about different type of exploitation techniques.

I have no professional experience , but I use to do bug hunting on synack platform.
