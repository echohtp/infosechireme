### Alex Lane
## Information Security Engineer

Alex Lane has been obsessed with hacking since he was a kid. He took a somewhat unconventional path into infosec following a decade-long career in film, TV, and theater production. Alex's interests in security and technology are wide-ranging, from microcontrollers and show control systems from his time in the interactive multimedia world, to a more recent immersion in enterprise networks, having fun with PowerShell, Active Directory, offensive, and defensive practices. He's attended many conferences and workshops over the past few years in addition to working as a Villages Goon (DEF CON 27), and continues to produce and direct independent theater and film work through his NYC-based nonprofit theater company. Alex believes strongly in the power of interdisciplinary study, especially with regard to the relationships between hacking, bioinformatics, and the performing arts.
