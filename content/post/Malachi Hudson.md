### Malachi Hudson
## Bartender

I am an avid learner with great leadership experience, looking to apply my networking and security knowledge from both my university and certification studies to join a strong team. I have a tremendous passion for both information security and technology. Having completed the www.cybrary.it/members/svelte8 material for CompTIA Networks+ and Security+ has prepared me for certification and granted me a deeper understanding of network and corporate security.

Plenty of leadership experience, high ropes course, and bartending. See my LinkedIn: https://www.linkedin.com/in/malachihudson/
