### Leon Watson
## NOC/SOC Engineer

Leon Watson is a Jr. Cyber Security Engineer and has been in the professional IT industry since 2015 and has done freelance work since 2013, helping small businesses all around the Mississippi Gulf Coast with their IT problems. As a certified junior penetration tester(eJPT) Leon spends his time on HackTheBox(HTB) expanding his knowledge on cyber security, and sharing that knowledge through YouTube videos or writeups on GitHub. 

4.5 years of professional IT Security, the last 2 have been incredibly focused in the Security IT. I currently work for a MSP that tasked me and another peer to build a security solution to sell. We managed to do so in 4 months and have now implemented it into our Complete solution. During this time I have also been tasked with doing several(10+) presentation across the Gulfcoast, for clients, education, awareness, conferences. I assisted with the discovery and remediation of a large scale ransomware attack on a city. I was able to determine the variant of ransom they were struck with and I was able to find "patient zero" and the Point-of-Entry through Windows Event Logs, to help solidify our investigation to present to the city and council.
